We're very open and accept contributions from Moq enthusiasts.
There are basically two ways of contributing: Contributing a Patch, and Joining the [Moq Contrib Project](http://moq-contrib.googlecode.com).

Read the following sections to determine whether you want to contribute as one or the other :)

# Contributing a Patch #

If you just came across a bug which you'd like to fix and contribute back, this is the easiest and less involved way of contributing.

We like the approach outlined in [Instiki](http://www.instiki.org/show/HowToContribute).
Scott Hanselman has also a good [overview of how to contribute](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExampleHowToContributeAPatchToAnOpenSourceProjectLikeDasBlog.aspx) using TortoiseSVN (our favorite SVN client).

Just make sure you replace the repository URL with ours: http://moq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ (see http://code.google.com/p/moq/source/checkout for more info)

We will improve these instructions, hopefully.

# Joining the [Moq Contrib Project](http://moq-contrib.googlecode.com) #

Just send an email to the [Moq Discussions](mailto:moqdisc@googlegroups.com) list asking to join.


Thanks for your interest in contributing and happy mocking!
